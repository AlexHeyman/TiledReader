TiledReader is a simple library for extracting information from the files produced by the map editor Tiled (https://www.mapeditor.org/). TiledReader makes the internal structure of Tiled map, tileset, and template files easy to navigate, but does not read in image data and cannot render Tiled maps by itself. Thus, TiledReader is most appropriate when you want to use Tiled in combination with your own graphics code.
